<p id="statement">
    At a macro level, I am interested in psychological processes of self-formation and
    identity development. At a more micro level, I am interested in everyday social
    process of identity performance, negotiation, and construction. Additionally,
    I study how social media, new media, and digital-physical interactions and spaces
    impact identity development and psychological well-being. Lastly, I use the insights
    from my study of identity to develop small, classroom-based interventions to improve
    academic outcomes for low-income and minority youth.
